    "    - policy iteration\n",

    "#### Q-Learning:\n",
    "- Does not use a model, but rather builds a table of utility values as the agent interacts with the world\n",
    "- What is Q?\n",
    "    - Q function Q[s,a] is viewed as a table here where s is the state we are looking at and a is the action we might take\n",
    "    - Q is the value of taking the action a given the state s\n",

    "    - given a policy pi(s), which gives the action given state s\n",
    "    - pi(s) = argmax_a{Q[s,a]} --> maximize Q given s and possible actions a\n",
    "    - After running Q-Learning long enough, you arrive at the optimal policy and optimal Q table\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building a Q-Table: (Training a Q-Learner)\n",
    "- General process:\n",
    "    - Select training data\n",
    "    - Iterate over time to produce experience tuples (s,a,s',r) \n",
    "        - Use these tuples to update Q-table\n",
    "    - Test policy pi(s)\n",
    "    - Repeat until learner converges (keep going until the return converges to some high value)\n",
    "- What happens when we are iterating over the training data?\n",
    "    - Set start tim, initialize a Q table Q[.]\n",
    "    - compute the state s\n",
    "    - select the action a\n",

    "    \n",
    "#### Update Rule:\n",
    "- How do you update the rule/policy given tuple (s,a,s',r)?\n",
    "    - Q'[s,a] = (1-alpha)Q[s,a] + alpha(improved estimate)\n",
    "    - That is, given old Q-value and improved estimate, we use a learning rate alpha (between 0 to 1.0, generally 0.2)\n",
    "    - Larger values of alpha make learning faster, and lower values make learning slower\n",
    "    - More formally:\n",
    "        - Q'[s,a] = (1-alpha)Q[s,a] + alpha(r + gamma(future r))\n",
    "        - Where alpha is the learning rate, gamma is the discount rate\n",
    "        - Higher gamma means we value future rewards MORE, while lower gamma means we value future rewards LESS\n",
    "    - How do you get the future r?\n",
    "        - future rewards = Q[s',argmax_a{Q[s',a']}\n",
    "        - given we end up in state s', if we act optimally, what would be the optimal reward along the actions available in the Q-table\n",
    "\n",
    "- The formula for computing Q for any state-action pair (s, a), given an experience tuple (s, a, s', r), is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>Q'[s, a] = (1 - α) · Q[s, a] + α · (r + γ · Q[s', argmaxa'(Q[s', a'])])</code>\n",

    "- Where:\n",
    "    - r = R[s, a] is the immediate reward for taking action a in state s,\n",
    "    - γ ∈ [0, 1] (gamma) is the discount factor used to progressively reduce the value of future rewards,\n",
    "    - s' is the resulting next state,\n",
    "    - argmaxa'(Q[s', a']) is the action that maximizes the Q-value among all possible actions a' from s', and,\n",
    "    - α ∈ [0, 1] (alpha) is the learning rate used to vary the weight given to new experiences compared with past Q-values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Comments:\n",
    "- Success of Q-Learning depends on exploration\n",
    "- One way to do this is using randomness, e.g. by randomly picking an action during training to see what happens such that a better Q-table can be generated\n",
    "- As training goes on, can do this with a random probability c at the beginning of learning that reduces over time, until c=0 and we use the optimal Q rule instead\n",

    "#### Q-Learning and Trading:\n",
    "- Actions in trading:\n",

    "    - Holding type (short, long, or not at all; can't sell if not holding!)\n",
    "    - return since entry (helps set exit points)\n",
    "- Given a state, the learner chooses to do an action\n",
    "- Rewards in a trading problem:\n",
    "    - could use r = daily return\n",
    "    - could use r = 0 until exit, then use r = cumulative return\n",
    "- Using r = daily return will get faster convergence for the learner, because the learning agent gets feedback on each individual action it takes, so Q-learner will update more frequently\n",
    "- Creating the state: (state is an integer, such that we can address it in the Q-table)\n",
    "    - discretize each factor\n",
    "    - combine the discretized factors\n",
    "    - e.g. four factors (X1,X2,X3,X4)\n",
    "        - discretized into four integers (0,5,9,2)\n",
    "        - stack them into discretized state 0592\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discretizing:\n",
    "- Need to pool data into bins that are given by a set of thresholds\n",
    "- To determine the thresholds:\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "    stepsize = size(data)/steps\n",
    "    data.sort()\n",
    "    for i in range(0,steps):\n",
    "        threshold[i] = data[(i+1)*stepsize]\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recap:\n",
    "- Building a model:\n",
    "    - define states, actions, and rewards\n",
    "    - choose in-sample training period\n",
    "    - iterate and update Q-table\n",
    "    - backtest until convergence\n",
    "- Testing the model:\n",
    "    - test on new data\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - The main advantage of a model-free approach like Q-Learning over model-based techniques is that it can easily be applied to domains where all states and/or transitions are not fully defined.\n",
    "    - As a result, we do not need additional data structures to store transitions T(s, a, s') or rewards R(s, a).\n",
    "    - Also, the Q-value for any state-action pair takes into account future rewards. Thus, it encodes both the best possible value of a state (maxa Q(s, a)) as well as the best policy in terms of the action that should be taken (argmaxa Q(s, a)).\n",
    "- Issues: \n",
    "    - The biggest challenge is that the reward (e.g. for buying a stock) often comes in the future - representing that properly requires look-ahead and careful weighting.\n",
    "    - Another problem is that taking random actions (such as trades) just to learn a good strategy is not really feasible (you'll end up losing a lot of money!).\n",
    "    - In the next lesson, we will discuss an algorithm that tries to address this second problem by simulating the effect of actions based on historical data.\n",
